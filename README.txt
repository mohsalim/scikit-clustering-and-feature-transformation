Make sure you have the following installed:

1. Python (3.5.1)
2. numpy
3. sklearn
4. arff
5. scipy
6. openpyxl

I used a lot of libraries, so please forgive me if I forgot to mention any.

Once you've done that, you can run the code by:

1. Run scikit_sample.py. This will run the code for the tic-tac-toe dataset (used in all 5 parts of the assignment).
2. You should have excel files. Store these because some of them will be over written by the next step.
3. Change run_first_data_set to True at the top of scikit_sample.py.
4. Run scikit_sample.py again. This will run the code for the nursery dataset (use in the first 3 parts of the assignment).
5. You should have some new excel files.

Note, I have some tweaked excel files under Final Excel which I used for the final analysis.
